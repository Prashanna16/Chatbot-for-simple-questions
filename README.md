This project presents an On-Topic Chatbot designed to answer simple questions based on a predefined domain. The main purpose of the chatbot is to assist users with quick, accurate responses on a specific subject area (such as DBMS, Python basics, school subjects, etc.). The chatbot is lightweight and can be implemented using rule-based or basic NLP techniques, making it ideal for academic demonstrations or small-scale support systems.
